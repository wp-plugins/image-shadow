Image Shadow automatically adds a soft, realistic drop-shadow to jpeg images in your posts

== Description ==

Some WordPress themes style images frames and drop-shadows. The Image Shadow plugin lets you have such image styling without having to use a special theme. It automatically adds a soft, realistic drop-shadow to the jpeg images in your post content. You can choose the shadow's depth and orientation. You can even add frame to the image. You can let the image grow a shadow or you can ensure that the shadowed image fits in the same space as the original. 

The shadowed images are cached on your server for fast delivery which means that your PHP setup must allow the creation of new files. You must also have the GD library installed.

**NB** The plugin is still in beta and I am aware that the settings screen, though functional, has problems in Internet Explorer.

== Installation ==

Image Shadow is installed in 3 easy steps:

   1. Unzip the "image-shadow" archive and copy the folder to /wp-content/plugins/
   2. Activate the plugin
   3. Use the Settings > Image Shadow admin screen to choose the kind of shadow you want. If you have javascript enabled you will have a live preview of your changes.
